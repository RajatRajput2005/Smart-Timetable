## üí° **TECHNICAL TALKING POINTS**

### **When Judges Ask "How Does The AI Work?"**
```
"Our system uses a genetic algorithm that evolves hundreds of timetable 
solutions simultaneously. Each solution is scored based on 15+ criteria 
including faculty conflicts, room utilization, student satisfaction, and 
NEP 2020 compliance. The best solutions reproduce and mutate to create 
even better schedules, just like natural evolution."
```

### **When Judges Ask "What Makes This Intelligent?"**
```
"The AI doesn't just follow rules - it learns and adapts. It can resolve 
10+ types of scheduling conflicts using multiple strategies per conflict. 
It predicts student satisfaction, optimizes resource utilization, and 
ensures government policy compliance automatically."
```

### **When Judges Ask "How Is This Better Than Existing Solutions?"**
```
"Traditional systems use manual scheduling or simple rule-based automation. 
Our AI uses evolutionary computation to explore thousands of possibilities 
and find truly optimal solutions. It's like having an expert scheduler 
working 24/7 with perfect memory and infinite patience."
